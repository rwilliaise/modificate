A Minecraft clone made for me and my friends. Uses Lua for implementing game mechanics such as blocks, items, and (hopefully) rendering for some blocks/items.

## Building

I use a full CMake buildsystem since I deploy across platforms (primarily Linux and macOS).

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
